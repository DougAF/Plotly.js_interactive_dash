In this repository we will build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity DataSet](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/).

Used Plotly.js to build interactive charts that pull data from a RESTful API for this dashboard. Great for making sense of a lot of data in a single webpage! Not a big fan of bubble or pie charts due to lack of clarity, but man are they pretty! Check out the app at the link above and visualize the data for a couple samples!
