## Project Info 
This project uses Plotly.js to build interactive charts that pull data from a RESTful API. Great for making sense of a lot of data in a single webpage! Not a big fan of bubble or pie charts due to lack of clarity, but man are they pretty! Check out the app at the link above and visualize the data for a couple samples!
